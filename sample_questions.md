### 1. What datasets should I use to understand hurricane dynamics?
Here are some NASA datasets that can help you understand hurricane dynamics:

**Tropical Cyclone Intensity (TCI) Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD) V2.1**
Summary: Data from the TCI field campaign aimed at improving the prediction of tropical cyclone intensity and structure change, focusing on upper-level outflow layer processes and dynamics. Data includes brightness temperature, rain rate, wind speed, and sea surface temperature estimates.

Time Period: August 30, 2015 - October 23, 2015

Organization: NASA/MSFC/GHRC


**HURRICANE AND SEVERE STORM SENTINEL (HS3) HURRICANE IMAGING RADIOMETER (HIRAD) V1**

Summary: Collected using a multi-band passive microwave radiometer designed to measure ocean surface wind speed in tropical storms and hurricanes.
    
Time Period: November 5, 2012 - October 17, 2014

Organization: NASA/MSFC/GHRC

**GRIP HURRICANE IMAGING RADIOMETER (HIRAD) V1**
    
Summary: Measurements from the GRIP experiment to better understand how tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes. Data includes brightness temperature, wind speed, and sea surface temperature.

Time Period: September 1, 2010 - September 16, 2010

Organization: NASA/MSFC/GHRC

NSF Collaborative Research: A RAPID response to Hurricane Harvey impacts on coastal carbon cycle, metabolic balance and ocean acidification
    Summary: Research focused on the impacts of Hurricane Harvey on the coastal carbon cycle, metabolic balance, and ocean acidification.
    Time Period: Starting from September 18, 2017
    Organization: NASA/GSFC/SED/ESD/GCDC/OB.DAAC

These datasets contain various types of data, such as radiometric, environmental, and ecological information, which can be crucial for studying the dynamics and impacts of hurricanes.

### 2. How do I study deforestation in the amazon region over the years 2014 - 2024?

To study deforestation in the Amazon region over the years 2014 to 2024, you can utilize the following datasets:

**LBA-ECO LC-14 Modeled Deforestation Scenarios, Amazon Basin: 2002-2050**

*Summary*: This dataset models future patterns of deforestation across the Amazon Basin from 2002 to 2050 under different scenarios. It provides insights into trends and projections that can be compared with actual data during your period of interest.

Organization: ORNL_DAAC

These datasets include modeled scenarios and past data, which can help you analyze deforestation trends over time and understand the potential impacts of different factors and policies on deforestation in the Amazon. They are especially useful for creating a comprehensive temporal analysis of deforestation patterns.

### 5. Can GOES data be used to study deforestation patterns? What other datasets are useful?

To determine if GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) data can be used to study deforestation patterns and to identify other useful datasets, I will search for Earth science collections related to the keyword "GOES" and "deforestation." This will help us understand the capabilities of GOES data and explore other relevant datasets.

#### GOES Data and Deforestation Studies

GOES Data:

The GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites) data collections available do not directly focus on deforestation. They are primarily centered on irradiance and sea surface temperature, which may not be directly applicable to studying deforestation patterns. Some relevant collections include:
- Daily Downward Longwave Irradiance - GOES: Measures the downwelling longwave irradiance on Earth's surface, useful in climate and radiation studies.
- GHRSST NOAA/STAR GOES-17 ABI L2P America Region SST: Focuses on sea surface temperature.

These datasets, while providing critical environmental data, do not directly address land cover changes like deforestation.
